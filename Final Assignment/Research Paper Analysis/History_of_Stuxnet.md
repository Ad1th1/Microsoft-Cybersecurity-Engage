These three takeaways are:
- Cyber attacks may be linked and can offer warnings of future threats
- Cyber attacks can confirm or reveal new attack vectors and tactics
- Speculative attribution can affect political tension and cyber deterrence

- four zero-day exploits there were a number of other advanced features including a Windows rootkit, a distributed command and control network, the ability to peer-to-peer update, legitimate signed digital certificates, and various antivirus evasion techniques.

- Stuxnet would check the system it was on to ensure that it was a gas centrifuge controller in the Natanz facility, run modules in its code to check the current settings and time on the device, decide if the settings and conditions were appropriate for an attack, and if everything matched perfectly it would spin the centrifuges faster than they were intended to go before slowing them back down again. The specific speed the centrifuge would speed up to, 1410 Hz, is the maximum degradation point for the type of centrifuges used at Natanz and would have required extensive knowledge on the devices to know.

- at least 1,000 centrifuges, of the 9,000 present at Natanz, were damaged beyond repair as a result of the Stuxnet infection.

- Takeaway #1: Cyber Attacks May Be Linked and Can Offer Warnings of Future Threats
