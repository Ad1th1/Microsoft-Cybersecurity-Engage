- using python to automate cybersecurity tasks
- check out MITRE ATT&CK and Shield frameworks

- Why Python?
  - popular
  - simple
  - capable -> large number of libraries, large amount of built-in functionality

MITRE ATT&CK
- tool developed by MITRE Corporation to improve cybersecurity understanding
- maps different techniques and procedures to the cyberattack life cycle and an adversary's goals

MITRE Shield
- developed by MITRE to promote active defense
- identifies different goals that an active defender may have and outline methods for achieving those goals

Important Terms:
- Tactic = goal at a particular stage of a cyber-attack or goal in active defense. Eg: lateral movement
- Technique = mechanism by which an attacker can achieve the goal outlined in a particular tactic. Eg: Brute force approach
  - Sub-technique = method for carrying out a particular technique
- Procedure = specific implementation of a particular technique or sub-technique
