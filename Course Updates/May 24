Interactive Session on ML in cybersecurity

 -> Saudi Aramco = first mass wipe cyber attac
 
 
 Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
 -> Threat and Vulnerability Management
 -> Attack Surface Reduction
 -> Next Generation Protection
 -> End-point detection and response
 -> Auto investigation and remediation
 
 -> Threat Hunters
 
 -> Ensemble Model
 -> Javascript Banking Trojan
 
 
 
 Malware Encounter at Client
 Cloud Metadata -> if suspicious send to cloud and assign risk factor after analysis
 Sample
 Detonate in a sandbox
 Big Data
 
 Types of ML
 -> Supervised
 -> Unsupervised
 
 Specially crafted files -> could be identified as anamoly even if they aren't
 -> identify signature fragments detected as malicious
 -> identify automated detection techniques
 -> inject signature fragments into clean files
 -> add crafted files to VirusTotal using TOR
 -> Automation signs, targeted clean files, multiple vendors have FP's
 
 Ensemble Classifiers:
 -> research on adversarial attack against deep-learning classifiers showing stcked ensemble helpers defend against attacks
 
 Feautures:
 Machine attributes : OS version, processor, security settings
 
 Behavioral, locale, partial and fuzzy hashes, full file content, file properties, signer info
 
 Threat Scenarios:
 Classifiers:
 -> Malware
 -> Clean
 -> PUA
 -> Enterprise Specific
 -> File-type specific
 
-> Boolean and Logistic STacking

-> Model Selection:
   > LightGBM
   > Logistic regression
   > XGBoost
   > Averaged Perceptron
   > DNN
   > Fast Tree
   
Experiment Design:
-> Supervised training -> Train
-> Optimization -> Validate
-> Evaluation -> Test

Data Leaks


-> Client AI and powerful, scalable cloud AI to protect patient 0
-> deep expertise in security and AI
-> focus on prevention, behavioral and EDR as a backstop
