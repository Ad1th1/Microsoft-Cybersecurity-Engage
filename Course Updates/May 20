Reverse Engineering

-> use C, Java, Python, x86, x86-64

-> static techniques 
    - no execution
    
-> dynamic techniques
     - run-time
     - easy to find dead code
     
Memory
-> divided into segment

high address
|
v
|
v
low address

environment variables, arguments

stack(grows downwards) = storage of temporal variables of limited size
heap(grows upwards) = storage of dynamic variables
.bss = stores non-initialized variables
.data = stores initialized variables
.text = program instructions and constants

# stack and heap
