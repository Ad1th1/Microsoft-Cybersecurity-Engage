   - log4j is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java
   - log4j has three main components:
      - loggers: Responsible for capturing logging information.
      - appenders: Responsible for publishing logging information to various preferred destinations.
      - layouts: Responsible for formatting logging information in different styles.
   - a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Log4j2, which is a Java logging library.

5. Emotet:
   - straightforward banking trojan -> first discovered in 2015

6. macOS Malware
   - These vulnerabilities, affecting WebKit, could expose iOS and macOS users to remote code execution attacks.
   - This malware could be a cryptojacker or ransomware, or perhaps a backdoor.
   - A backdoor could be used to steal sensitive information that could be used for blackmail, or to otherwise harm the targeted organization. An attacker could also cause a targeted device to become unusable, which would result in a denial of service and interruptions to operations.
   - McSnip Backdoor malware -> the malicious binary was impersonating a screenshot tool that could be downloaded
directly from a website, rather than from the actual legitimate App Store
