-  cyber-security strategies tend to rely on technological measures like air gaps, firewalls, and antivirus tools that have been proven fallible to the exclusion of other, perhaps more effective
measures.

- At some point in 2009, the attacker changed course and deployed a second version of Stuxnet.
This time, the malware targeted a dif­ferent component: Siemens 315 programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that controlled centrifuge frequency converters, which are responsible for determining
rotor speed. This was a much easier attack, and the methods by which the malware achieved it
were far more direct than those of the first Stuxnet version.


- Unlike the first stage of the attack, this version was able to self-replicate within specified networks
and transfer via removable stick drives to all kinds of computers. However, like the first version,
it would only execute when it detected the specific Siemens PLC configuration it targeted. This
version was also loaded with “zero day vulnerabilities” or undiscovered flaws in Microsoft Windows
software. These are rare, and can go for hundreds of thousands of dollars each on the open
market—indicating either a wealthy attacker, a technically sophisticated attacker, or both. Finally,
this stage of the attack was accompanied by stolen digital certificates, which masked the malware
as legitimate software and prevented its rejection by updated Windows operating systems.1
