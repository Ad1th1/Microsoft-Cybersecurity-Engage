These three takeaways are:
- Cyber attacks may be linked and can offer warnings of future threats
- Cyber attacks can confirm or reveal new attack vectors and tactics
- Speculative attribution can affect political tension and cyber deterrence

- four zero-day exploits there were a number of other advanced features including a Windows rootkit, a distributed command and control network, the ability to peer-to-peer update, legitimate signed digital certificates, and various antivirus evasion techniques.

- Stuxnet would check the system it was on to ensure that it was a gas centrifuge controller in the Natanz facility, run modules in its code to check the current settings and time on the device, decide if the settings and conditions were appropriate for an attack, and if everything matched perfectly it would spin the centrifuges faster than they were intended to go before slowing them back down again. The specific speed the centrifuge would speed up to, 1410 Hz, is the maximum degradation point for the type of centrifuges used at Natanz and would have required extensive knowledge on the devices to know.


- at least 1,000 centrifuges, of the 9,000 present at Natanz, were damaged beyond repair as a result of the Stuxnet infection.

- Takeaway #1: Cyber Attacks May Be Linked and Can Offer Warnings of Future Threats


-  Duqu only used one zero-day which was an exploit based on a vulnerability in Microsoft Word fonts.
-  Duqu was set to only infect its intended targets and was designed as a remote access trojan (RAT). RAT styled malware have been used in targeted cyber attacks before with the specific purpose of cyber
espionage.
- The link between the two pieces of malware is their use of shared source code through a coding platform known as Tilded.

- Many current defense systems rely on signature based detection to defeat malware. As malware is identified and analyzed, a signature is built for sensors and programs so that when it is detected trying to enter a system it can be
blocked.

- Conficker, Flame, Duqu

- the ability to inject read and write code on a controller, as Stuxnet did, identified a method of bypassing safety features at control systems across the world. Disabling or tampering with safety features in control systems can result in the
direct loss of human life. 

- The Stuxnet cyber attack is the most high profile cyber attack to date. It was the product of some of the best programmers and control systems experts in the world.
