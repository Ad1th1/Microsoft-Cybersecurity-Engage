- invaluable tool for Blue-teamer

- Capturing volatile data in a computer's memory dump enables investigators and examiners to do a full memory analysis and access data including:
   - browsing history\
   - encryption keys\
   - chat messages\
   - clipboard contents \
   - run-time system activity\
   - open network connections (often these artifacts are only found in RAM)\
   - recently executed commands and processes\
   - injected code fragments\
   - memory stored before shut down or crash
   
- Tools for Memory Capture:
    FTK Imager - Link\
    Redline - Link *Requires registration but Redline has a very nice GUI\
    DumpIt.exe\
    win32dd.exe / win64dd.exe
   usually output a .raw file
   
    
 - Profiles determine how Volatility treats our memory image since every version of Windows is a little bit different.
