- A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.


- Stateful firewalls are capable of monitoring and detecting states of all traffic on a network to track and defend based on traffic patterns and flows.
- Stateless firewalls, however, only focus on individual packets, using preset rules to filter traffic.

- While Network Based Firewall filters traffic going from Internet to secured LAN and vice versa, a host based firewall is a software application or suite of applications installed on a single computer and provides protection to the host.

- A DMZ Network is a perimeter network that protects and adds an extra layer of security to an organizationâ€™s internal local-area network from untrusted traffic. A common DMZ is a subnetwork that sits between the public internet and private networks.

The end goal of a DMZ is to allow an organization to access untrusted networks, such as the internet, while ensuring its private network or LAN remains secure. Organizations typically store external-facing services and resources, as well as servers for the Domain Name System (DNS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), mail, proxy, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and web servers, in the DMZ.
